Outside is a 2D game in development made by me, which led me to enter the world of game creation.

As part of the PAP (Professional Aptitude Test), I intended to create a 2D game (two dimensions) in Unity (a program for game development).
The idea for this project came about because I have always seen video games as one of the best artistic mediums, and I decided that I wanted to make one, applying my computer skills as well.
With this game, I aimed to stimulate reasoning through puzzle-solving and combat strategies.

The game's theme is an RPG (Roleplaying game) with real-time combat, whose objective is to escape from a dungeon where the protagonist has been imprisoned. To achieve this, the protagonist will have to defeat enemies to advance to the next level and solve puzzles to obtain the keys that will open the door to his freedom.

The resources used were Unity to create the game, Visual Studio 2019 to create scripts in the C# language, Mega to store project data, and Paint.Net for the game's design.

Developed by Hugo Barros.
