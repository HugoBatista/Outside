Outside is a 2d game made by 3 young people who developed into the world of games in creation within one of the games.
Introduction...

As part of the PAP (Professional Aptitude Test) we intend to make a 2D game (two dimensions) in Unity (program to develop games).

The idea of this project we have always faced with video games as an artistic medium and also because we want to make one by applying our better computer skills.

With this game, we intend to stimulate the game by solving puzzles and combat strategies.

Project description...

The game's theme is RPG (Roleplaying game) with a turn-based combat style whose objective is to escape from a dungeon where the protagonist has been imprisoned. To do this, the protagonist from defeat to move to the next will have and solve puzzles to get the keys to open their freedom.

The resources that will be Unity for creating the game, Visual Studio 2019 for creating Scripts for the game, Mega for storing project data and Paint.Net for designing the game.

Directed by Hugo Barros, Ricardo Gomes and Ângelo Costa.
